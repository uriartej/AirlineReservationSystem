# Flight It Your Way

For this project, I am proposing an application that can focus on the customer first rather than the airline company. 
This will be done in allowing the customer to have more options to choose to enhFlance their flight experience. This 
will be done in three parts. The first part will allow the customer to choose their streaming option such as Netflix,
Hulu, and more. The second part will allow the customer to choose what type of setting they would like to sit in. 
Options range from a work study environment to an area of kids sitting in the environment. The third option is allowing 
the customer to choose what type of lunch or dinner they would like to devour from a large list of options in the food 
menu. The goal of these three parts is to favor the customerâ€™s experience on a flight and at the same time make it at 
an affordable price. For many people flights seem to be a burden to experience, with the creation of this application 
I want to change that burden to a more positive experience.
